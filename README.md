# cppyy: Automatic Python-C++ bindings

This is the repo to accompany the [Python Bindings cppyy](https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) documentation.

cppyy is an automatic, run-time, Python-C++ bindings generator, for calling C++ from Python and Python from C++. Run-time generation enables detailed specialization for higher performance, lazy loading for reduced memory use in large scale projects, Python-side cross-inheritance and callbacks for working with C++ frameworks, run-time template instantiation, automatic object downcasting, exception mapping, and interactive exploration of C++ libraries. 

cppyy is based on Cling, the C++ interpreter, to match Pythonâ€™s dynamism, interactivity, and run-time behavior. 

To run the [tutorial](https://github.com/wlav/cppyy/blob/master/doc/tutorial/CppyyTutorial.ipynb) do the following:
```
python tutorial.py
```
